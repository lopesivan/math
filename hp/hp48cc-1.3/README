This package is written in ANSI C and was tested only under SuSE Linux 7.2,
but should compile with little or no change under any other UNIX OS.

`hp48cc' is a C-like compiler that translates input code into the
HP48 RPN language.  The language recognized by the compiler is only a small
subset of the C language with some non-standard extensions.  However,
the language is powerful enough to write complex programs simply.

Please take a look at the examples contained into the `examples' directory
for learning the syntax of this compiler.
